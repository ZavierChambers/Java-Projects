# SimpleJavaExamples

The goal of this folder is to display a few of my Java example projects to those who are just starting there career in Java development.

I will be uploading videos along with these small projects as a way to display my skill as well as aid others in their understanding of Java and the things that this development can do for them in there goals to become a future software enginer.

If you desire to make changes or add to this list of projects and I would be more than happy to make something happen.
